## Object detection using Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50) and YoloV

### Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50)
To run the Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50) model, please navigate to the Faster R-CNN folder and run the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```
This folder contains the natively trained Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50) model on the Lego dataset, with a fairly small data size (as of 31 Oct 2024), and equally small epoch, batch size, and learning rate. <br>

All imgs and annotations were preprocessed and stored in the lego_dataset folder, re-labelled only in one "lego" class. <br>

As for now, the result, mAP, is painful. <br>
